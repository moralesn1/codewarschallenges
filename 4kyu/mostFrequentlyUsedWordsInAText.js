// Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), returns an array of the 
// top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.
// Assumptions:

//     A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII.
//     Apostrophes can appear at the start, middle or end of a word ('abc, abc', 'abc', ab'c are all valid)
//     Any other characters (e.g. #, \, / , . ...) are not part of a word and should be treated as whitespace.
//     Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
//     Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
//     If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, 
//     or an empty array if a text contains no words.
